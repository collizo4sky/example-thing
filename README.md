=============

Example Thing!

In this exercise, we will support a new shortcode: `thing`

Activate the plugin to see a working example of a shortcode being parsed, edited, updated, and rendered.

To get started, create a Post in the WordPress editor with the following content:

`[thing]`

Click it to edit.

Note: you need to be running WordPress 3.9 (currently `trunk`) or later
